# BOOK_GPT_BASIC

this code creates an interactive web application where users can enter the name of a book and get information about the book, its author, and other books by the same author, using an OpenAI model.

Make sure all the imported modules (os, key, langchain.llms, langchain, langchain.memory, langchain.chains, streamlit) are installed in your environment.
Ensure that the openai_key is correctly set in your key module and is being correctly set as an environment variable.
